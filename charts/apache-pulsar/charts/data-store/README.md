To disable the periodic check completely, set this to 0. Note that periodic checking will put extra load on the cluster, so it should not be run more frequently than once a day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `604800`                                                           |

| `config.compactionMaxOutstandingRequests`        | Sets the maximum number of entries that can be compacted without flushing. When compacting, the entries are written to the entrylog and the new offsets are cached in memory. Once the entrylog is flushed the index is updated with the new offsets. This parameter controls the number of entries added to the entrylog before a flush is forced. A higher value for this parameter means more memory will be used for offsets. Each offset consists of 3 longs. This parameter should not be modified unless you’re fully aware of the consequences.                                                                             | `100000`                                                           |

| `config.flushInterval`                           | How long the interval to flush ledger index pages to disk, in milliseconds. Flushing index files will introduce much random disk I/O. If separating journal dir and ledger dirs each on different devices, flushing would not affect performance. But if putting journal dir and ledger dirs on same device, performance degrade significantly on too frequent flushing. You can consider increment flush interval to get better performance, but you need to pay more time on bookie server restart after failure.                                                                                                                 | `60000`                                                            |

| `config.gcWaitTime`                              | How long the interval to trigger next garbage collection, in milliseconds. Since garbage collection is running in background, too frequent gc will heart performance. It is better to give a higher number of gc interval if there is enough disk capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `900000`                                                           |

In general, incrementing pageLimit, using smaller index page would gain better performance in lager number of ledgers with fewer entries case If pageLimit is -1, bookie server will use 1/3 of JVM memory to compute the limitation of number of index pages. | `0`                                                                |
