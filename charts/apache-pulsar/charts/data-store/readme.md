# Pulsar Bookkeeper

Pulsar creates it's own version of Bookkeeper bookies but follows the general principles of Bookkeeper administration. There are noticeably less config values to choose from because Pulsar can make assumptions from it's own configuration.

## Startup Flow

As the helm chart starts a pulsar based Bookkeeper instance there is work done to get it's configuration ready. One of the jobs of this chart is to
make configuration straight forward and do the work of converting the desired values into a format that Pulsar Bookkeeper understands.

1. Write the provided values in `.config` into a configmap
2. Attach that configmap to each Bookkeeper instance
3. Use `scripts/apply-config-from-env.py` python script (provided in the Pulsar container) as a container arg, to convert the attached env values into `conf/Bookkeeper.conf`
4. Start the Pulsar Bookkeeper instance, providing the location of the conf file

## Configuration

Given the version tag of Pulsar container being used in this chart, the labels and values within the `.config` area should follow Pulsar's options. You'll notice only a few of the possible configuration values are set. These are very specific things to running a Pulsar cluster in Kubernetes and the defaults need to be changed.

The list of possible configuration values is long. Include them as you see fit. Refer to [Pulsar's Bookkeeper documentation](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/next/reference-configuration-bookkeeper) for all possibilities and the default values.

*Note* - the use of the prefix "PULSAR_PREFIX_" with some values. This is used so when `scripts/apply-config-from-env.py` runs, these values will be converted into Bookkeeper conf.

## Statefulset versus Daemonset

You have the option to run the bookie(s) as either [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) or [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) objects. [Bookkeeper documentation](https://bookkeeper.apache.org/docs/deployment/kubernetes) recommends DaemonSet, so that is the default of this chart. But DaemonSet isn't always an option in all K8s installs. So the alternate StatefulSet is offered. Set the `.asStatefulSet: true` value to deploy as StatefulSet.

*Note* - a big difference between Daemonset and Statefulset is the replica count. As a Daemonset, replicaCount is decided by the number of hosts in the cluster. The `.replicaCount` value is ignored. Does this work for your needs?

## Headless service

Bookkeeper recommends deploying each bookie service as [headless](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services). Because all that's needed in the cluster are DNS records, there is no external access/routing needed. This chart follows that pattern.

## Disks

You are most likely using Pulsar for its guaranteed delivery and persistent store. The data store facilities that. Its disk(s) are at the heart of those options. First, the chart offers an overall `.persistence.enabled` option. If set to `false` no cluster data will survive an instance restart or reschedule. That option is really just for development purposes. The default is `true`.

There are 2 main areas of data - "journals" and "ledgers". Both of which area a part of persisting messages. The chart offers an option to combine these areas into a single disk, as `.persistence.oneDisk.enabled`. The default is `false` but if set to `true`, the journals and ledgers will be stored on a single disk in separate folders. There is no real advantage to this option, it's just a convenience to have them as one. Or could make a development environment a little less complicated.

The default is to give journals and ledgers their own disk. While this does add a some complication to the statefulset, it offers the most flexibility when choosing sizing and storage class.

If you are using function workers, is an option for an additional "ranges" disk which stores function state. This disk is not enabled by default but if `.persistence.ranges.enabled` is set to `true` then a third disk will be created. If the ranges disk is enabled and `.persistence.oneDisk.enabled` is also set to `true`, then ranges will be given its own folder on that single disk.

To facilitate data durability, this chart offers an option to create a storage class for each data type automatically. When persistence is enabled, and both `storageClass` and `existingClaim` are left blank on any data type, a new `storageClass` object will be created in the namespace. The storageClass objects are specific to the chosen storage strategy. If the `oneDisk` option is enabled but neither `.persistence.oneDisk.storageClass` or `.persistence.oneDisk.existingClaim` are provided, the cluster will not start properly.

## Bookie Cluster

This chart assumes a Zookeeper meta data store has already been created. There is a required value of `.config.PULSAR_PREFIX_zkServers` where a comma delimited list of Zookeeper addresses (with client port) is expected. An example value would be: `zk-1.default.svc.cluster.local:2181,zk-2.default.svc.cluster.local:2181,zk-3.default.svc.cluster.local:2181`. With this each Bookie instance is given the ability to retrieve its configuration from a Zookeeper leader.

During the chart's installation (ie: `.Release.IsInstall = true`) a Kubernetes job is created that attempts to configure a Bookkeeper cluster. This is done using the bookkeeper CLI command [`bin/bookkeeper shell initnewcluster`](https://bookkeeper.apache.org/docs/reference/cli#bookkeeper-shell-initnewcluster). The job uses the same configuration as the Bookies.

*Note* - there is also a helm template that can override the `.config.PULSAR_PREFIX_zkServers` value. The reason for this additional option is, when creating a new cluster the address of each Zookeeper instance is calculated. So only when an entire cluster's chart is calculated does one know what this value should be. So offering this function allows the parent chart to override the template which in turn override's the value. The parent template calculates the correct value.
